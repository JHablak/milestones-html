  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <p>CSS is short for cascading style sheets. Whereas HTML is used to write content for your page, CSS is used to style it. You can use it to change the background of your page, change the font and font-size, add borders, and much much more. There are three ways to add CSS to your html page:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Inline - CSS applied individually to each element</li>
    <li>Internal CSS - CSS consolidated in <code>head</code>. This method is good for writing CSS for one page.</li>
    <li>External CSS - CSS written in a separate file and linked to the head of each HTML page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To style this page, I am going to use internal CSS.</p>
