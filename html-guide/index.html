  <h1>Julia's Study Guide for HTML & CSS</h1>
  <p>This is a study guide I made so that I (and potentially others) can better understand the basics of HTML and CSS. To start, here is a screenshot showing how to start your website from the command line/gitbash:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>pwd</em> means present working directory and is used to see what directory (file) you are currently in.</li>
    <li><em>mkdir</em> is used to make a new directory.</li>
    <li><em>cd</em> is used to move into another directory. In this case, I want to move into the directory I just created, "julia's-study-guide".</li>
    <li><em>touch</em> is used to make a new file. The homepage will always be called "index.html"</li>
    <li><em>code .</em> is used to open the files in that directory in VScode.</li>
  </ul>
